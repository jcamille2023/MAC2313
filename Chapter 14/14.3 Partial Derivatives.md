### Computing the Partial Derivative
In general, if $f$ is a function of two variables $x$, and $y$, suppose we only let $x$ vary by while keeping $y$ fixed. In a sense, this function is a function of one variable; it would become $g(x)=f(a,b)$. If $g$ has a valid derivative at point $a$, **then $f_{x}(a,b)$ is the partial derivative of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$.**
Example 1: Find the partial derivative of $f(x,y)=x^3+3x^2y+y$. Compute the derivative with respect to $x$ and $y$.
Respect to $x$:
$$f_{x}(x_{0},y_{0})=\frac{\delta f}{dx}(x^3+3x^2y+y)$$
$$f_{x}(x_{0},y_{0})=3x^2+6xy_{0}$$
Respect to $y$:
$$f_{x}(x_{0},y_{0})=\frac{\delta f}{dy}(x^3+3x^2y+y)$$
$$f_{x}(x_{0},y_{0})=(3x^2+1)$$
In essence, partial derivatives simply involve treating the variable that is not given respect when differentiating as a constant, and differentiating as a one variable function.

### Geometric Interpretation of the Partial Derivative
We begin with the function $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$. $f$ is a type of quadric surface known as an elliptic paraboloid. The function $g(x)= f(x,y_0)$ is a parabola inside the plane $y=y_0$ (a cross section of the paraboloid). Accordingly, the derivative of $g(x)$, or the partial derivative of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$ is the slope of the tangent line to the cross-section $g(x)$. $g(x)$ describes how $f(x,y)$ will change over time with respect to $x$.

In the image above, you can see a plane, a cross section of such plane (the graph of $f(x,y_0)$), and the tangent line to the cross section.


### Higher Derivatives
If a function $f$ is a function of two variables, then its partial derivatives $f_x$ and $f_y$ are also functions of two variables, and accordingly each have two partial derivatives.
$$(f_{x})_{x}=\frac{\delta^2f}{dx^2}$$
$$(f_{y})_{y}=\frac{\delta f}{dy^2}$$
$$(f_{x})_{y}=\frac{\delta f}{dx\space dy}$$
$$(f_{y})_{x}=\frac{\delta f}{dy\space dx}$$
Under most circumstances, $f_{xy}(a,b)$ and $f_{yx}(ab)$ are the same. This concept is known as **Clairaut's Theorem**.
(Higher derivatives can have notation of $f_{xxy}$ or $\frac{\delta^3f}{dx^2dy}$. These notations are identical and take the exact same steps.

### Partial Differential Equations
Partial differential equations (PDE) involve a function $u$, variables, and partial derivatives of some order (i.e. $f_{xxy}$ is a third-order PDE). 
An example of a PDE is Laplace's equation:$$u_{xx}+u_{yy}=0$$
Solutions to this are called **harmonic functions**, which often model electric fields, heat transfer, and fluid flow.

Most problems involving these will simply ask to prove a harmonic function is a solution of a partial differential equation.
