### Velocity, Speed, and Acceleration
Given $r(t)$ is the position vector of a particle moving in space, its velocity vector is $r'(t)$. Thus, the velocity vector $v(t)$ is also the tangent vector $T(t)$ and points in the direction of the tangent line. The speed of the particle is the norm of the velocity vector $$\frac{ds}{dt}=|r'(t)|=|V
(t)|$$
Similarly, the acceleration vector of the particle is defined as $V'(t)$ or $r''(t)$.
#### Newton's Second Law of Motion
If a force that acts on a particle is known, then the acceleration can be found based on the second law of motion:$$F=m\vec{a}(t)$$
Example 4: An object with mass $m$, that moves in a circular path with constant angular speed $\omega$ has position vector $r(t)=a\cos(\omega t)\vec{i}+a\sin(\omega t)\vec{j}$. Find the force acting on the object and show that it is directed towards the origin.
- First, we must find the acceleration$$r'(t)=-a\omega \sin(\omega t)\vec{i}+a\omega \cos(\omega t)\vec{j}$$
$$r''(t)=-a\omega^2\cos(\omega t)\vec{i}-a\omega^2\sin(\omega t)\vec{j}$$
- Then, we can plug it into the equation for force. $$F=m(a\omega^2\cos(\omega t)\vec{i}-a\omega^2\sin(\omega t)\vec{j})$$
$$F=-ma\omega^2\cos(\omega t)\vec{i}-ma\omega^2\sin(\omega t)\vec{j})$$

$$F=-m\omega^2(a\cos(\omega t)\vec{i}-a\sin(\omega t)\vec{j})$$
- From here, it becomes evident that$$F=-m\omega^2*r(t)$$
- Given that the position vector points outside the circle, we can see that the force vector points inward toward the center.
