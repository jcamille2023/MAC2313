This section covers two types of 3D surfaces: **cylinders** and **quadric surfaces**.
## Cylinders
- A cylinder is a surface that consists of all lines (called **rulings**) that are parallel to a given line and pass through a given plane curve.
- For example, the graph of the surface $z=x^2$ is a parabolic cylinder.
