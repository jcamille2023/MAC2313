This section aims to set the foundations to be able to describe how a point is moving in space. 
## Vector Functions
- A vector function is a function whose domain is a set of real numbers and whose range is a set of vectors. 
- We are most interested in vector functions **r** whose values are 3D vectors.
- If $f(t)$, $g(t)$, and $h(t)$ are the components of the vector $r(t)$, then such components are referred to as the **component functions of $r$** and we can write $$r(t)=\space <f(t), g(t), h(t)>$$
- Example: Sketch the curve $r(t)=(\cos t)\vec{i}+(\sin t)\vec{j}+t\vec{k}$
	- This curve will lie in the plane $x^2 + y^2=1$.

		- The $z$ coordinate of the function is increasing, which is why it goes up, but the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are sinusoidal. 
### Limits and Continuity
- The limit of a vector function **r** is defined by taking the limit of its component functions. $$\lim_{  t\to a }{r(t)} = \space<\lim_{ t \to a } f(t) , \lim_{ t \to a } g(t), \lim_{ t \to a } h(t)  >$$
- The limits of all component functions must exist for this definition to be valid.
- Furthermore, a vector function $\textbf{r}$ is continuous at $a$ if$$\lim_{ t \to a }r(t)=r(a) $$
- Previous definition of a limit must be applied.
