### Lines
- A ine in the *xy*-plane is determine when a point on the line and the direction of the line are given. The equation of the line can then be written using point-slope form
- Similarly, a line $L$ in 3D space can represented by a point $P_{0}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ on $L$ and a direction for $L$, described by a vector $V$ parallel to the line. 
- Given a second point $P(x,y,z)$, and that $r_0$ and $r$ are the position vectors of $P_0$ and $P$ respectively, if $a$ is the vector with representation $\vec{P_{0}P}$, then the Triangle Law for vector addition gives that $$r=r_{0}+a$$
- which is demonstrated in the figure below.

Since $a$ and $v$ are parallel, there is a scalar $t$ such that $a = tv$. Thus:$$r=r_{0}+tv$$
where $r$ is the position vector for any point on the line $L$ given the scalar $t$ is defined. 
We can rewrite the vector $tv$ in component form as $v=<ta,tb,tc>$. Currently, the position vector for each point on line $L$ is $$r=r_{0}+<ta,tb,tc>$$
If we add the vector $r_0$ to the vector in component form, we'd get:$$r=<x_{0} + ta,y_{0} + tb,z_{0} + tc>$$
Each of components of the vector are known as parametric equations. We currently have 3: $$x = x_{0} + ta, y = y_{0} + tb, z=z_{0}+tc$$
These represent the line $L$ on a 3D plane.

Example 1:
(a) Find a vector equation and parametric equations for the line that passes through the point (5,1,3) and is parallel to the vector $i+4j-2k$.
$$x_{0} = 5, y_{0} = 1, z_{0} = 3$$
The parametric equations are:
$$x=5+t, y=1+4t,z=3-2t$$
The vector equation is:$$r = <(5+t)\mathbf{i},(1+4t)\mathbf{j},(3-2t)\mathbf{k}>$$
(b) Find two other points on the line.$t=1,t=2$
$$P_{1}= <6, 5, 1>,P_{2}= <7, 9, -1>$$
Generally, if a vector is used to describe the direction of a line, then its components are called **direction numbers of L**. Any vector parallel to such a vector can also be used to describe the direction of the line, so any three numbers proportional to the original components can be used.

Given the vector $v=<a,b,c>$You can eliminate the parameter $t$ from the parametric equations to form a symmetric equation of line L:
$$\frac{x-x_{0}}{a}=\frac{y-y_{0}}{b}=\frac{z-z_{0}}{c}$$
### Planes
- Although a line in space is determined b a point and a direction, a plane in space is more difficult (easier according to Sica?) to describe. 
- While a single vector parallel to a plane cannot convey its direction, a vector *perpendicular* to the plane *can* convey its direction. 
- Given this, we can define a plane using a point $P(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ in the plane and a vector $n$ which is perpendicular to the plane. This vector is referred to as a **normal vector**. 
- Let $P(x,y,z)$ be some point in the plane and let $r_0$ and $r$ be position vectors of points $P_{0}$ and $P$ respectively. 
- Then vector $r-r_{0}$ is represented by $\vec{P_{0}P}$, and the normal vector $n$ is orthogonal to every vector in the given plane, especially $r-r_0$. Thus: $$n*(r-r_{0})=0$$ as the vectors are perpendicular. This can be rewritten as$$n*r=n*r_{0}$$
- Both equations are **vector equations of the plane.**
- To find the **scalar equation** of the plane, we can convert the vectors to component form and find their dot product.$$<a,b,c>*<x,y,z>-<x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}> = 0$$ $$<a,b,c>*<x-x_{0},y-y_{0},z-z_{0}> =0$$
$$a(x-x_{0})+b(y-y_{0})+c(z-z_{0})=0$$
This is the scalar equation of a plane through point $P_0$ with normal vector $n = (a,b,c)$.

Example: Find an equation of the plane that passes through the points $P(1,3,2)$,$Q(3,-1,6)$, and $R(5,2,0)$
Step 1: **Find the normal vector**.
We can do this by finding two vectors in the plane and finding their cross product. In this instance, we will be using $\vec{PQ}$ and $\vec{PR}$.$$\vec{a} =Q-P =  <3-1,-1-3,6-2> = <2,-4, 4>$$
$$\vec{b} = R-P\space=\space <5-1,2-3,0-2> \space= \space<4,-1,-2>$$
Now, we can find their cross product using matricies.
$$\begin{bmatrix}
i&j&k \\
2&-4&4 \\
4&-1&-2
\end{bmatrix}$$
$$i*\begin{bmatrix}
-4&4 \\
-1&-2
\end{bmatrix} - j*\begin{bmatrix}
2&4 \\
4&-2
\end{bmatrix}-k*\begin{bmatrix}
2&-4 \\
4&-1
\end{bmatrix}$$
$$((-4*-2)-(4*-1))i-((2*-2)-(4*4))j-((2*-1)-(4*-4))k$$
$$(8+4)i-(-4-16)j-(-2+16)k$$
$$v=12i+20j+14k$$
$v$ is the normal vector of the plane.
Step 2: **Apply the formula.**
$R$ will continue to have coordinates at $(x,y,z)$.
$$<12,20,14>*(<x,y,z>-<1,3,2>)\space=0$$
$$<12,20,14>*<x-1,y-3,z-2>\space=0$$
$$12(x-1)+20(y-3)+14(z-2)=0$$
This is the equation for the plane, which can be simplified to:
$$12x-12+20y-60+14z-28=0$$
$$\boxed{12x+20y+14z=100} $$
Example 2: Find at which point the line with parametric equations $x = 2+3t$, $y=-4t$, and $z=5+t$intercepts the above plane.
Step 1: **Substitute the parametric equations into the plane equation.**
$$
12(2+3t)+20(-4t)+14(5+t)=100 \\
24+36t-80t+70+14t=100
$$
